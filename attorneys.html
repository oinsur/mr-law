                  Theodore Raymundo Markowski was born and raised in El Paso,
                  Texas. He received his Bachelor of Science in Sociology, with
                  a Minor in Criminal Justice from Northern Arizona University,
                  and his Juris Doctor from Arizona Summit Law School, where his
                  coursework focused on business transactions. During law
                  school, he gained additional civil experience through
                  internships in tort law and bankruptcy. After spending nearly
                  a decade in Arizona, Theodore returned to the local area,
                  joining the Dona Ana County District Attorney’s Office. There,
                  he prosecuted for the State of New Mexico, honing his
                  litigation and trial skills through the prosecution of
                  hundreds of cases. For almost four years, Theodore has been in
                  private practice, handling a wide range of civil disputes,
                  including family law and domestic violence cases. This routine
                  engagement with complex family law and domestic violence
                  disputes has broadened his expertise, making him highly
                  competent in various civil areas. This extensive experience,
                  combined with his time at the DA's office, makes him confident
                  and capable in addressing diverse legal issues. He is now
                  focused on leveraging his diverse experience to achieve
                  successful outcomes for his clients in emerging business
                  areas, while being fully prepared to litigate matters if
                  necessary.<br />
