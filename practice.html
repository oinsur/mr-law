                                <p>We understand the impact that criminal charges can have on lives and reputations, and we are committed to protecting your rights and pursuing justice on your behalf.</p>
                                <h3>1) MISDEMEANORS</h3>
                                    <p>A misdemeanor is a criminal offense that is generally punishable by less than one year in jail, fines, community service, or probation. These offenses are less serious than felonies but more severe than infractions.</p>
                                
                                    <ul>
                                        <h3>Examples include:</h3>
                                        <li>- Simple assault</li>
                                        <li>- Battery of a Household Member</li>
                                        <li>- Disorderly Conduct</li>
                                        <li>- Violation of a Restraining Order</li>
                                    </ul>
                                
                                    <p>Misdemeanors, while considered less severe than felonies, can still have significant consequences. That is why our goal is to minimize the impact on your life by ensuring we protect your rights and achieve the best possible outcome for your case.</p>
                                
                                
                                    <h3>2) FELONIES</h3>
                                
                                    <p>A felony is a serious criminal offense that is punishable by more than one year in prison. Felonies are often categorized by the severity of the offense, and they typically have long-lasting consequences for those convicted.</p>
                                
                                
                                    <h3>Examples include:</h3>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>- Drug offenses</li>
                                
                                        <li>- Violent crimes- murder, assault with a deadly weapon, robbery, etc.</li>
                                
                                        <li>- Sexual offenses</li>
                                
                                        <li>- Property Crimes – burglary, arson, etc.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                
                                    <p>When facing felony charges, the stakes are high. Felony convictions can lead to severe penalties, that can impact you and your family for years to come, which is why it’s critical to have experienced legal representation.</p>
